Types of Software Testing
 





1.	Functional Testing
2.	Non-Functional Testing
 




•	Functional testing is the process through which QAs determine if a piece of software is acting in accordance with pre-determined requirements.

•	It uses black-box testing techniques, in which the tester has no knowledge of the internal system logic.
 



•	Unit testing
•	Smoke testing
•	Web testing
•	Manual testing
•	Automation testing
 
•	Unit testing is a type of testing in which individual units or functions of software testing. Its primary purpose is to test each unit or function. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. It mainly has one or a few inputs and produces a single output.
•	Two types of unit testing
1.	Manual testing
2.	Automation testing
 

•	Manual Testing is a type of software testing in which test cases are executed manually by a tester without using any automated tools.
•	The purpose of Manual Testing is to identify the bugs, issues, and defects in the software application.
•	Manual software testing is the most primitive technique of all testing types and it helps to find critical bugs in the software application.
 

•	Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite.
•	The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports.
•	Software Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.
 



•	Performance testing
•	Load testing
•	Security testing
•	Usability testing
•	Compatibility testing
 


•	Performance Testing is a software testing process used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability and resource usage of a software application under particular workload.

•	Speed – Determines whether the application responds quickly
•	Scalability – Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.
•	Stability – Determines if the application is stable under varying loads
 

•	Compatibility Testing is a type of Software testing to check whether your software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications, network environments, Mobile devices, Browsers.
•	Types of compatibility testing
1.	Hardware
2.	OS
3.	Software
4.	Devices
5.	Mobile
 

•	Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users.
•	The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.
 




•	Yes. It is important to know about the different types of software testing and at the same time, to achieve the best and effective testing services based on your project or application type.
